description: Edit and polish respondent-facing Chinese wording for Digital Diary / DG questionnaire drafts while preserving research intent, module structure, observation points, brand-exposure timing, and task logic. Use when the user asks to rewrite, naturalize, de-checklist, reduce burden, remove excessive parentheses/examples, adjust tone for respondents, or prepare DG questions for a separate wording agent after a questionnaire designer agent has produced a research-logic draft.

# DG Question Wording Editor

Use this skill to turn a research-complete DG / Digital Diary draft into respondent-facing wording that feels natural, open, answerable, and low-burden.

This skill is a wording layer. Do not redesign the research plan unless the wording problem reveals an obvious research-risk question for the designer agent.

## Gold Data Priority

When `gold_data/reports/wording_patterns.json` or other database-derived final DG wording pattern files are available, use them as tone and naturalness references only:

- Existing style rules, rewrite patterns, fixed templates, designer handoff constraints, Brief/Proposal/client requirements, and brand-exposure rules take priority.
- Gold wording samples can suggest natural openings, soft media requests, and module tone.
- Do not copy historical respondent-facing questions mechanically.
- If a gold wording sample conflicts with current style rules or fixed templates, follow the current rules and record the conflict as an eval note.
- Promote a wording pattern into the skill only when it appears repeatedly and improves respondent naturalness without increasing burden or exposing intent too early.
- Do not inject raw database JSON or full wording pattern files into normal rewrite prompts. Use gold data offline to distill compact rewrite rules, then promote reviewed rules into this skill.

## Core Boundary

Preserve:

- Module order and module purpose.
- Research intent, observation points, Diary vs IDI split, task timing, and brand-exposure timing.
- Required fixed templates, especially About Me opening questions.
- Any client-required item, screener, stimulus, or platform constraint.

Edit:

- Respondent-facing module names. By default, convert every respondent-facing module title into a first-person "我 / 我的 / 我是 / 我怎么..." style title unless the client requires a fixed title or the output is explicitly internal-only.
- Respondent-facing questions.
- Module introductions and endings.
- Media request wording.
- Repetitive examples, parentheses, forced list formats, rigid scoring/ranking language, and checklist-like phrasing.

Do not:

- Delete a question only because it is awkward. Rewrite first.
- Add new research objectives.
- Expose internal labels, client strategy, or brand/product intent earlier than the source draft.
- Turn open Diary tasks into closed survey questions unless the source explicitly requires it.

## Required References

Before rewriting a DG draft, read:

- `references/style-rules.md`
- `references/rewrite-patterns.md`
- `references/module-tone-guides.md`

When evaluating or producing a review report, also read:

- `references/wording-eval-rubric.md`

## Workflow

Always work in this order:

```text
Input diagnosis
-> Preserve research intent
-> Rewrite respondent-facing wording
-> Reduce burden and rigidity
-> Check brand exposure and fixed templates
-> Output revised wording
```

## Input Diagnosis

Identify affected text types:

- module intro
- respondent-facing question
- media/material request
- module ending
- internal note accidentally exposed to respondents
- researcher-facing structure or logic that should be preserved outside the respondent question

Classify wording problems with these labels:

- `too_checklist_like`
- `too_commanding`
- `too_many_parentheses`
- `too_many_examples`
- `too_quantified`
- `too_generic`
- `too_specific_in_a_forced_way`
- `respondent_burden_too_high`
- `brand_or_intent_exposed_too_early`
- `internal_logic_exposed`
- `fixed_template_violation`

## Rewrite Rules

Rewrite toward natural Diary tasks:

- Use conversational Chinese.
- Prefer real moments, scenes, people, before/after changes, and reasons.
- Keep examples light and optional.
- Make media requests optional unless required by project or platform.
- Use fewer rigid counts, rankings, and scoring tasks.
- Keep the respondent's emotional and cognitive load low.

If the source wording contains research logic after each question, move it out of the respondent-facing question. Keep it only as a short researcher note when needed.

## Output Modes

For direct rewriting, output only the revised section unless the user asks for a full draft.

For review plus rewrite, use:

```markdown
## Wording Diagnosis
- module/question:
- issue:
- preserve:
- rewrite approach:

## Revised Wording
...
```

For multi-agent handoff, return:

```markdown
## Wording Pass Complete
- preserved research intent:
- major wording changes:
- remaining research questions for designer agent:

## Revised DG Wording
...
```

Keep explanations brief. The main deliverable is the revised respondent-facing wording.
